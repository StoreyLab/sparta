SPARTA
=========

Separate Parental Alleles for Reads from Tangled Alignments (SPARTA)

Divide RNA-Seq reads from pooled runs based on their ancestral genotype. Designed to be used as a post-processing step for Bowtie2, after aligning the pooled reads to both ancestral genomes.

To run unit tests, simply run test_sparta.py

Run sparta.py from the command line without arguments or with the -h option to see description of command line options.
