\section*{June 9, 2014}
Today I did not yet have Emily's code available to study or access to the cetus data, so instead I focused on preparing my workstation and reading literature related to my project. I focused on Skelly et al (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202289/) because it is perhaps the most relevant to what I am doing.
